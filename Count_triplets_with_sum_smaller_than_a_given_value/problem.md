# Count triplets with sum smaller than a given value

## Given an array of distinct integers and a sum value. Find count of triplets with sum smaller than given sum value. Expected Time Complexity is O(n2)

```txt
Examples:

Input : arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
        sum = 2.
Output : 2
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 2
               (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3) 

Input : arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
        sum = 12.
Output : 4
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 12
               (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7) and 
               (1, 4, 5)
