# Find the minimum distance between two numbers

## Given an unsorted array arr[] and two numbers x and y, find the minimum distance between x and y in arr[]. The array might also contain duplicates. You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr[]


```python
# Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2}, x = 1, y = 2
Output: Minimum distance between 1 
and 2 is 1.
# Explanation: 1 is at index 0 and 2 is at 
# index 1, so the distance is 1

Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5}, x = 3, y = 5
Output: Minimum distance between 3 
and 5 is 2.
# Explanation:3 is at index 0 and 5 is at 
# index 2, so the distance is 2

Input: 
arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3},  
x = 3, y = 6
Output: Minimum distance between 3 
and 6 is 4.
# Explanation:3 is at index 0 and 6 is at 
# index 5, so the distance is 4

Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3}, 
x = 3, y = 2
Output: Minimum distance between 3 
and 2 is 1.
# Explanation:3 is at index 7 and 2 is at 
# index 6, so the distance is 1
```

> Note:- X and y are not same and both are present inside the array.
