# Majority Element

## Write a function which takes an array and prints the majority element (if it exists), otherwise prints “No Majority Element”. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element)

```python
Examples : 

Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4}
Output : 4
Explanation: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater
than the half of the size of the array size. 

Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
Output : No Majority Element
Explanation: There is no element whose frequency is
greater than the half of the size of the array size.
