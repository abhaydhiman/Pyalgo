## Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing the links between nodes

Examples: 

Input: Head of following linked list 
1->2->3->4->NULL 
Output: Linked list should be changed to, 
4->3->2->1->NULL

Input: Head of following linked list 
1->2->3->4->5->NULL 
Output: Linked list should be changed to, 
5->4->3->2->1->NULL
