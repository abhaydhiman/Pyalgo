# Print missing elements that lie in range 0 â€“ 99

## Given an array of integers print the missing elements that lie in range 0-99. If there are more than one missing, collate them, otherwise just print the number. Note that the input array may not be sorted and may contain numbers outside the range [0-99], but only this range is to be considered for printing missing elements
