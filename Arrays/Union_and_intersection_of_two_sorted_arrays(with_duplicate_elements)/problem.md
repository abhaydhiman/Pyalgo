# Union and Intersection of two sorted arrays but now there may exist duplicate elements

## Given two sorted arrays, find their union and intersection

### Example:-

```python
Input : arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7}
        arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6}
Output : Union : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
        Intersection : {3, 5}

Input : arr1[] = {2, 5, 6}
        arr2[] = {4, 6, 6, 8, 10}
Output : Union : {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
        Intersection : {6}
```

### Assumptions:-

* Arrays should be in sorted order.

* The length of two arrays may or may not be equal.
