## Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays

```txt
Examples:

Input:
ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80

Input:
ar1[] = {1, 5, 5}
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10}
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: 5, 5
